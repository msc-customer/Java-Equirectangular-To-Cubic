    /**
     * This script serves up parts of a .bigshot image pyramid archive.
     * It is controlled with five parameters:
     *
     * file : the path to the .bigshot file, relative to the script
     *
     * Either
     *     start : offset in bytes from the start of the file
     *     length : number of bytes to read
     * or
     *     entry : the name of the entry in the bigshot archive.
     *
     * Using the "entry" parameter requires two extra file accesses server side.
     * It is recommended that a client parses the file header and index and then
     * uses the start/length combo to read the data from the archive. The purpose
     * of the "entry" parameters is to make it possible to use, for example, 
     * SaladoPlayer, to show VR panoramas archived in a Bigshot archive.
     *
     * type : MIME-type for the Content-Type header being returned.
     *
     * To avoid path traversal attacks, the script will only read from 
     * files ending in ".bigshot", and will remove any ".." and "." path 
     * components from the file name. It will also remove any initial slashes.
